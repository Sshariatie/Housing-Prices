# Housing-Prices

Used **regression techniques** to predict the prices of houses to make  informed decision.

To build accurate model with linear model function, **binary classification** method was used to create new columns returning categorial values. Employed one feature selection method **(RFE)** to trim Housing prices dataset. Modeled the output with three regression techniques **(Linear Model, Regression Tree, Random Forest, Xgboost)** in language R. Used two measures of model accuracy **(Mean Absolute Error, Root- Mean-Square Error)** to see how far the predicted price is from the true value with 73% error distribution.
